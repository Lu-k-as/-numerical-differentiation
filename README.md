This project is a discussion focused on numerical differentiation, with some theoreticall and some practical input.

The code runs in matlab and tests the three kind of algorithm (single side differentation, double side differentation, extrapolated differentiation), discussed theoretically, with three functions (polynomial function, exponential function, logarithm function).

This work was done in cooperation with Sebastian Feichtenschlager.
